# Balance - Short relaxation agar cell game.
Drag to create cell; right-click to purge a cell; left-click to split cell.

# Creating
Dragging will create a cell with the starting spot as center. Red means invalid area; make sure the outline is white before releasing or nothing will happen.

# Purging
Right-click the cell to watch it get sucked away and dissapear.

# Splitting
Left-click to split a cell. The place you click within the cell will affect the size split. For example, clicking right in the middle should split it in half, while clicking at the borders will split it into a big one and a small one.
